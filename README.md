- 👋 Hi, I’m @MavTac
Student, father and many other things. Pushing to get my student days behind me to jump into the field, and start getting some real experience. 

I have been many things professionaly such as a Chef, Floorer, Boilermaker, Security Officer, Retail Worker and so forth. However I've always had a love for computers.
I'll admit this grew from a boyish love of video games and wanting to understand more about the engine behind the glossy hood. 
Just looking to find people like me to learn and grow with, maybe even make some peers for the future!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

Cyber Security, as this is a massive field I am obtaining skills in many areas. Though the main points of focus currently would be:
  - Programming
  - Cyber Analyst skills
  - Networking skills
  - Risk Management skills
  - Critical Thinking skills
  - Research and Reporting skills
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...

At the moment, looking into a basic project of a Web Scrapping program aimed at pulling all relevant Technology, Cyber Sec, AI and Programming articles and POI's into one .txt file filled with the links to said articles.

To expand upon this, I would like to learn how to create a dashboard that catagorises and perhaps even some graphical design on said dashboard.
